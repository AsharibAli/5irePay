# 5irePay is PayPal for crypto. 

This project aims to become PayPal for crypto but with lower charges, no waiting time, and is powered by blockchain technology.

## Problem & Solution Statement

Freelancers and merchants have to pay high fees to centralized web2 companies, which is why I built 5irePay. With this, you can send crypto to anyone using just an email address, which means it is as simple as other web2 companies but with the benefits of 5ire blockchain.

To receive crypto payments, you don't need to set up any external wallet; you can directly log in with your Google account hassle-free and start sending and receiving payments using only your email address. We are on a mission to make people's lives easier by abstracting complex processes.
